# Shipping

## Purpose

Shipping methods with per-zone flat rates, country-based shipping zones,
and per-order shipments with manual carrier tracking.

## Responsibilities

- Manage translatable shipping methods (code, active flag, position).
- Manage shipping zones and their country coverage — a zone with no
  countries acts as a "rest of world" fallback.
- Manage flat per-zone rates per method (`price = 0.00` means free
  shipping).
- Quote available methods + costs for a country (checkout integration via
  the ShippingGateway).
- Track one shipment per order through a guarded status lifecycle and
  mirror the order status: `shipped` → order `SHIPPED`, `delivered` →
  order `COMPLETED`.

| `Rate`              | Price for a method on a zone                                        |
| `Shipment`          | Standalone model — orders are only referenced via the order gateway |

## Events emitted

| Event                    | When                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `ShipmentCreatedEvent`   | A shipment is created for an order (status `pending`) |
| `ShipmentShippedEvent`   | Shipment transitions to `shipped`                     |
| `ShipmentDeliveredEvent` | Shipment transitions to `delivered`                   |

Also, through the Order gateway: `OrderShippedEvent` (shipment →
`shipped`) and `OrderCompletedEvent` (shipment → `delivered`).
